# Test of the Performance real-time target machine 4684
Workflow:

1. main_sim_131.m 		        sets the simulation parameters
2. speedgoat_test_IO131.slx 	is the simulink model to be build and deployed in the target machine
3. plot_signal.m 		        plots the results of the simulation, it shows how to deal with multiple simulation outputs
